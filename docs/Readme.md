# Documentation


The scripts assume that blender is installed at `/home_local/${USER}/blender/blender-2.81-linux-glibc217-x86_64`.
If this is not the case please change it in the [Makefile](Makefile).

You can regenerate the documentation by executing:

```bash
./generate.sh
```

The main index file will be at: BlenderProc/docs/build/html/index.html
